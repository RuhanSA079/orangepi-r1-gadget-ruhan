# orangepi-r1-gadget-ruhan
Gadget Snap for OrangePi R1

This repo is an experimental repo for the Orange Pi R1, used much of Ogra1's OrangePi-Zero gadget as a template, modified for the OrangePi-R1.

This is just an experimental project, to see if I can get Ubuntu Core running on the unit.
I am using the 2021.xx branch of u-boot, the patch maybe does not apply anymore.
